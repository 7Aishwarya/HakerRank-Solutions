'''You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line 
ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump.
The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump.
You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. 
If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.

For example, kangaroo 1 starts at x1=2 with a jump distance v1=1 and kangaroo 2 starts at x2=1 with a jump distance of v2=2. 
After one jump, they are both at x=3, (x1+v1 = 2+1 ,x2+v2 = 1+2), so our answer is YES.

Input Format
A single line of four space-separated integers denoting the respective values of x1, v1, x2 and v2.

Constraints
0<=x1<x2<=10000
1<=v1<=10000
1<=v2<=10000

Output Format

Print YES if they can land on the same location at the same time; otherwise, print NO.
