'''HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round  up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
