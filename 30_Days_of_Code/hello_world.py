'''To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. 
on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
input_string = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')
print(input_string)

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
